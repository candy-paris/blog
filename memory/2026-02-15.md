- Session started after installing OpenClaw and configuring cron jobs.
- Fixed health check and heartbeat to only report on issues.
- System initially had many pending updates (64 packages).
- Issues resolved: Memory files created, UI build attempted, sudoers configured for apt.
- Next: wait for automatic updates to complete at 4am or manually run later.
